Rocky is 7 years old.
I have had him in my care since May. He is on a healthy diet and supplements. 
I will forward the medical details. 
I had him neutered, vaccinated and he had dental work done.

A large vet bill like for Muffins and Rocky care limits our ability to rescue more animals.

Meet Muffins who is an extremely affectionate two year old.

Muffins arrived from a high kill shelter with his brother in May 2024 to our foster volunteers. Both boys were due to be adopted together. But two weeks later, Muffins was experiencing lethargy, not eating and breathing with effort. 
Immediately, he was admitted in the ER at Angell Memorial Jamaica Plain, and  was diagnosed with having cardiomyopathy which will need follow up care. 

Muffins deserves to be in his own home where he can have his freedom and a warm lap to enjoy life. He loves watching the wildlife activities from his cat tree.
The cardiology care for Muffins will be paid for his first three years. Muffins is a lovable boy who takes his daily medicine very well. Consider opening your heart and home to Muffins. He will bring so much joy to your day.
