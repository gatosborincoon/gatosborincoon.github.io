Stef, Casper and Dallas  Love Story
It was only supposed to be 1 week of fostering a kitten for my landlord until my move-out day. 
I didn't hesitate to tell her yes and the love that came into my life was sudden and totally unexpected. This love is beyond what words can not express.
Once week turned into three, and then Casper became our forever companion for me and Dallas, my dog.

He came to me from Puerto Rico via some independent rescuers volunteers that asked for help for a blind kitty. My landlord rescued a cat 2 years ago and decided to do more for less fortunate cats that are strays. 
She pledged to get Casper's mother TNR and save this kitten. Kakashi is Casper's nickname. Kakashi he was their first official rescue as Gatos Borincoon, Inc. an organization that focus on TNVR of community cats in the Island, and takes in stray or abandoned cats that need veterinary care and finds them loving homes.

Despite his congenital medical needs, Casper is blind, he is the most independent and carefree kitty I've even seen! He gives us so unforgettable moments each and every day. He enjoys being able to explore, car rides, going outside and mingle with people and pets. 
He is a cuddle-love bug and brings so much joy into every life he enters, into Wendy's lfe, into my life, into my dog Dallas lonely days and friends and family.
He loves to play and purr. He is the perfect companion on days that I work from home office.


Casper  teaches us all the meaning of resiliance and gratitude. 
I hope we will be in each other s lives for a very long time. We need each other always and forever.
