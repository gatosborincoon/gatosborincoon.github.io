                <p>Early one day in February, after taking a red eye flight and driving one hour and a half, I decided to take the
                    scenic route instead of the highway to go visit my parents. I drove for a while and stopped to take a picture of a
                    tree fern on the side of the road at the state forest. A tree fern like any other tree fern which I’ve seen hundreds
                    of times, in that same road, going to my hometown. What happened next was not something that happened hundreds of
                    times.</p>
                <p>That sound. I turned, listening. Heard it again. Now I'm totally intrigued, to the point of crossing the road to
                    listen closer to what sounded like a cat's meow.
                    I've never had a cat, but do recognize that sound.</p>

                <p>I'm not seeing anything but more of the ferns that I'd stopped to photograph, and more tall grass at the edge of
                    the
                    forest.</p>
            
                <p>"Kitty Kitty , come out of the forest. If you come out, I"ll take you with me" .</p>
            
                <p>Did I really just say that?
                    The grass began to quiver and the low ferns parted; it revealed an orange cat.
                    Fearless. Determined. He walked directly towards me, stared directly into my eyes and "Meow".</p>
            
                <p>I kept my promise.
                    This orange kitty willingly came in my car and together we continued on through the forest, down the mountain,
                    stopping at the nearest grocery store to get cat food.</p>
                <p>It was heartbreaking, yet heartbuilding, to watch him devour the food, then look at me scared like something was
                    going to happen to him.</p>

                <p>My arrival was on a weekend, but I was able to call around to find a vet and get him the medical attention he needed.
                    Other than being a little bit thin from living on his own for who knows how long, he was in remarkably good health.
                    The vet thought he was about 8 months old. What made me decide to take this on? I don't recall actually thinking
                    about it, I just did it. I had the vet do his exams, vaccines and anything else he needed, and thus, I became his
                    guardian. Or maybe he was the one that adopted me.</p>
                    <p>For 10 days we traveled around during this trip. I set a litter box in a corner of the hotel rooms. Dishes and food
                        set out.</p>

                <p>I didn’t know anything about cats then. I never had a pet before, but we have learned to communicate with each
                    other.
                    I downloaded an e-book about cats and cat behavior, I was now the one devouring information.
                    The rest has been a remarkable life changing experience. My home changed. There's a dedicated "cat room". There
                    are cat trees in other rooms. Baskets of toys, and toys to trip over. Two catios have been added on to the
                    house, with a long winding enclosed tunnel connecting them, allowing safe outdoor exploration. And somewhere
                    along the way, Leo, for that's how I came to know him, acquired a rescued family that he has become the leader
                    and teacher of.
                    We still go for car rides daily, he will meow until I tap my shoulder for him to jump up as we've practiced,
                    then into
                    the car- usually a coffee run drive through, where he sits on the dashboard in his kingly manner to greet staff
                    as I
                    humbly wait for my order. If I don't bring him, I'm greeted with a barrage of questions, staff worrying,
                    "where's
                    Leo??".
                </p>
                <p>One and a half years later I formed a non-profit company to help other stray cats like Leo find the love and life
                    they deserve. Today, Leo probably doesn't remember much of those days, but I think he does.</p>
            
                <p>He still meows a lot. He is willful, determined, and fearless. And so very affectionate. We still go on car rides
                    very often. Leo is a perfect, happy "forest" cat who loves posing, making new friends, and his mind known.</p>
            
                <p>He's a cat that unknowingly changed the lives of dozens of other stray cats because of his encounter with me that
                    day
                    at the forest’s edge.</p>
            
                <p>This was my very first cat I rescued. And the start of a love story that has changed me and others forever.</p>

                    She pledged to get Casper's mother TNR and save this kitten. Kakashi is Casper's nickname. Kakashi was their first
                    official rescue as Gatos Borincoon, Inc. an organization that focuses on TNVR of community cats in the Island, and

                    I traveled to Puerto Rico in July with Leo in tow. Leo was now a little over 1 years old and wanted
                    to find
                    a companion for him. I visited some relatives that lived near a cat colony. The cousin of a cousin
                    knew of 3
                    female cats and came over with one. I saw a truck pull over and a white haze jumped from the moving
                    car.That
                    was her!. She had the wits and a match for Leo. The day he saw Selena was love at first sight. He
                    touched
                    nose and was quiet for a very long time. And Leo, he is never the silent type!

                <p>
                    Again we set to travel places and now Leo and Selena rode in the back of the car. He was the teacher
                    and she
                    was a good girl following him everywhere in the hotel rooms. He taught her how to use the litter,
                    how to
                    hunt and as I watched unfold in front of my very eyes, they began the most beautiful of friendships.
                    And of
                    course love developed. He now has a friend and playmate. And I also know they are madly in love with
                    each
                    other.

                    In December just 5 months after adopting Selena, I witnessed the loss of most of her cat line, just
                    gone. Dad, Mom,
                    Sister and 2 brothers die due to car accidents near the colony where they lived. The only 2
                    surviving relatives, a
                    brother called Luma and a pregnant sister named Carina who were in the hands of a neighbor who took
                    care of them. I
                    came in February and was able to hold the last litter born. In May I flew to Puerto Rico to rescue
                    Carina and the
                    kittens were old enough to wean. I found guardians for Zaney and Shadow, the other Tiger also
                    adopted. Today I don’t
                    get to see Carina’s pictures often but the kittens, now big cats, I am lucky that the guardians send

                    already
                    named Lily so she got renamed.

                    Lily became Yuki like the Yunque Forest that Michelle loved so much in her visit to Puerto Rico.
                    Also
                    reminded me of the
                    Taino deity Yukiyu.

                    She again found the story so fitting that she got the name her Yuki. Turns out that Yuki is a love
                    bug and loves to cuddle!

                    I submitted an application for a Flight Angels® for Boston so I could bring Pebbles too. Chris loves
                    Pebbles and she lets Chris play dress up with her. She knows she is loved every single day.

                    Noelle was a feral kitten once. Her mom Lola is a feral cat. She was brought into the rescue at 4 months and it took a
                    while for Noelle to allow the foster mom to touch her. But she needed to get adopted. Her other 2 siblings in foster had
                    been adopted and she deserved a great story as well. This is where Kerry took a chance. A challenge that required
                    patience and consistency. Today that paid off in heaps. Kerry became a better person for Noelle learning to love and
                    showing affection outwardly and along with cat-brother Otto both were rewarded by the unconditional love of a cat. One
                    year later Noelle is the affectionate loving cat she was always destined to be and also a Fluffy Princess.
